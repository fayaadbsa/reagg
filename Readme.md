## Deployment notes

### Config on vanilla server:
1. install git 
  ```
    sudo yum install git
  ```
2. install nvm (different in every host server)
3. install node with same version as the project 
  ```
  nvm install v14.15.1
  ```
4. install latest npm
  ```
  npm install -g npm@latest
  ```
5. install "forever" for run app
  ```
  npm install -g forever 
  ```
6. (optional) install dbms
### Deploying app using git:
1. git clone repo (maybe need more config on private repo)
2. npm install all modules (root, api, client)
3. (optional) maybe need to move folder or change dir and clean old folder
### Run app on server by running the backend(port api, source Lynda):
1. Running the app
  ```
  forever start -c "npm run serve-be" . 
  ```
  > there's space between " and .
2. Check the running app
  ```
  forever list
  ```
3. map port api (8080) to http port (80)
  ```
  sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 8080
  ```
  > dont forget to add http rule (tcp 80) on host server from anywhere ip
